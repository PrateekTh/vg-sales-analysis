# Exploratory Analysis of Video Games Sales Data

This project aims at evaluating Videogames sales data, up-to-date till 2024, and achieve valuable insights in the process. Several trends that can be observed through the analysis are expanded on at each step.

Eventually, K-Prototype clustering is performed in the end, to identify key differences and hallmark properties of games that have been performing really well (and ones that are not), in sales, based on features in the dataset.
