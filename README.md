# Exploratory Analysis of Video Games Sales Data

This project aims at evaluating Videogames sales data, up-to-date till 2024, and achieve valuable insights in the process. Several trends that can be observed through the analysis are expanded on at each step.

Eventually, K-Prototype clustering is performed in the end, to identify key differences and hallmark properties of games that have been performing really well (and ones that are not), in sales, based on features in the dataset. Clustering also helps to bring out previously unforseen patterns in the data, that may be affecting sales.

## Visualisation and Exploratory Analysis
Visualisation is done based on quite some criteria:

1. Top Selling Games: A brief analysis of the top ten games, based on franchises.
2. Platform-Wise Top Selling Games: A look into the overall top platforms, with respect to a sales of a single game.
3. Publisher Analysis: An overview of top publishers, their best titles, and the brief dive into possible reasons of success.
4. Genre Based Analysis: A Study of various different genres such as Action, Adventure, Platformer, etc.. and their impact on sales.
5. Release Dates and Sales: A Visualisation and Analysis of effects of release dates on games, and also their overall evolution over the years.
6. Critic Scores: A study of impact of critic scores on game sales.
